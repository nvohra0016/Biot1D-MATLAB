# 1D Biot's poroelasticity equation solver using MATLAB

Author: Naren Vohra, Malgorzata Peszynska

The 1D poroelasticity code is used to model deformation and flow in fully saturated porous media using the quasi-static Biot's equations. The code is written in MATLAB.

## Simulation example

To run example 1:

``` [xn, xcc, t, U, P, Q] = Biot1D(10, 10, [0 0 0 0], 1);```

To run example 4:

``` [xn, xcc, t, U, P, Q] = Biot1D(20, 100, [1 0 0 1], 4); ```
